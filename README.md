# 👋 Hey, I'm K Kevin Gladson (a.k.a. ScarZeus ⚡)

Backend warrior by day, bug slayer by night. I tame APIs, wrestle with Kafka streams, and occasionally talk to databases like they’re alive. If it's Spring-based, scalable, and secured — I probably built it (or broke it and fixed it later).

## 🧰 Tech Arsenal

These are my tools of choice for coding chaos into clean:

- 🧠 **Languages**: Java (my ride or die), Python (for brains), JavaScript, Dart, C (when feeling brave)
- 🛠 **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Web (basically anything with "Spring")
- 🔒 **Security**: JWTs, OAuth2 — because your secrets deserve secrets
- 📬 **Messaging**: Kafka – my go-to for whispering between microservices
- 🧘‍♂️ **Databases**: PostgreSQL (the grown-up choice), MongoDB (because sometimes I like chaos)
- ☁️ **Stuff in the Cloud**: Firebase, Cloudinary, Docker
- 🎧 **Real-time**: WebSockets + STOMP (my chat apps don’t wait)

## 🧪 Projects that Actually Work™ (most of the time)

### 📚 Bookstore Microservices
> *Because monoliths are so last season*

- Microservices galore (catalog, orders, users, auth)
- Kafka doing its messaging magic
- Secured with JWT + OAuth2
- REST APIs with Spring Boot elegance

---

### 😐 Emotional CNN
> *Because I wanted my code to understand feelings too*

- Python + CNNs to detect your mood
- Deployed with Spring so even the backend can feel things

---

### 🛒 DriveNShop
> *For those who love groceries and clean architecture*

- Manages products, billing, inventory
- PostgreSQL loves it, Hibernate kisses it
- Not available on Amazon... yet

---

### 🗨️ Chat API (Because silence is boring)
> *Real-time chat with Spring & STOMP – now with fewer dropped messages!*

- WebSocket wizardry
- Spring Security for safe gossip
- MongoDB storing all your drama

---

## 🧠 What I'm Currently Up To

- Figuring out how to scale Spring apps like Netflix (but on a student budget)
- Learning AWS + Kubernetes (aka DevOps Gym)
- Contributing to Spring projects (or at least pretending to)
- Blending ML with backend – I like my apps smart
